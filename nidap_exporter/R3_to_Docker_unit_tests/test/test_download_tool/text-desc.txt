# Unit test for download_tools.
This test compares the downloaded file from current run get_data.R and the baseline result.
The ouput from runme will be the difference between the md5 hash of downloaded rds and the baseline, and report difference if exists.
If no difference, the output should be "Two R-script files are the same."
