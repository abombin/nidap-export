# This file is to compare topological sorting from transform.R
This test compares parsed topological sorting in run_pipeline.sh from current run and the baseline result.
The ouput from runme will be the difference between current topological sorting and the baseline, and report difference if exists.
If no difference, the output should be "Two tolological sort files are the same."
